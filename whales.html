    <h1>Whales</h1>

    <p>Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal
    grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong
    to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the
    hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and
    toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant
    families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale),
    Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the
    dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).</p>

    <h2>The Blue Whale</h2>

    <p>The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whale suborder Mysticeti. Reaching a
    maximum confirmed length of 29.9 meters (98 feet) and weight of 173 tonnes (190 tons), it is the largest animal known to
    have ever existed. The blue whaleâ€™s long and slender body can be various shades of grayish-blue dorsally and somewhat
    lighter underneath.</p>

    <h2>The Sperm Whale</h2>

    <p>The sperm whale or cachalot[a] (Physeter macrocephalus) is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed
    predator. It is the only living member of the genus Physeter and one of three extant species in the sperm whale family,
    along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale of the genus Kogia.</p>
